 * Makes the decorated property linked to the GUI created from the given asset file.
 * Once the script is instantiated, the reference to the gui texture is created from the asset file
 * and assigned to the property. Gui link cant' be used in constructor and its creation is asynchronous.
 * @param pathInAssets defines the relative path (as it is in the assets browser in the editor) to the .gui file.
 * @param onGuiCreated defines the optional callback that is called when the GUI is created.
 * @example
 *  @guiFromAsset<MyScriptClass>("ui.gui", (instance, gui) => instance._onGuiLoaded(gui))
 *  private _ui!: AdvancedDynamicTexture;
