# Adding Files

To add files, simply browse the desired folder and click the button `Import...` in the Assets Browser toolbar.
A dialog will open to select the files to add. Once selected and validated, all the selected assets will be copied to
the currently browsed folder.

Each time a file has been added, its thumbnail will be computed if its type is recognized and supported.
