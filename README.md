# Babylon.js Editor 5

**Focus more on creating and less on coding.**

## Introduction

The Babylon.js Editor is a desktop application used to create and edit 3D scenes using the Babylon.js framework.
The Editor is available on both Windows and macOS.

It includes built-in templates, including a Next.js template, allowing you to bypass the tedious setup process and dive straight into building your project.

## Prerequisites

### Prerequisites for Window

On **Windows**, you need some tools to be present in the system like Python and C++ compiler. Windows users can easily install them by running the following command in PowerShell as administrator:

```bash
# For more information see https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

The following are also needed:

- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) - only the "Desktop C++ Apps" components are needed to be installed
- Spectre-mitigated libraries - In order to avoid the build error "MSB8040: Spectre-mitigated libraries are required for this project", open the Visual Studio Installer, press the Modify button, navigate to the "Individual components" tab, search "Spectre", and install an option like "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (Latest)" (the exact option to install will depend on your version of Visual Studio as well as your operating system architecture)

### Prerequisites for macOS

On **macOS**, you need to install XCode in order to compile native modules used by the Editor.
You can get XCode from the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

### Prerequisites for Linux (apt)

```bash
sudo apt install -y make python build-essential
```

## Installing and building

First, install the dependencies. This repository uses yarn classic.

```bash
yarn install
```

To build the editor and its associated tools, use the "build" command:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Running

Using the command line at the root of the repository, just type:

```bash
yarn start
```

The devtools will open automatically.

## Developing

To watch the Editor and its dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
yarn watch-editor-all
```

Using Visual Studio Code, you can also use a specific task to watch the Editor and other packages.
Just type `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on macOS) and select the task `watch-all-editor`.

Before contributing, please ensure that all code is formatted correctly and respects the project's coding rules.
You can lint files using the following command:

```bash
yarn lint
```

And you can fix all fixable issues using:

```bash
yarn lint-fix
```

## Packaging

Due to the native dependencies, builds on macOS must be performed on a macOS machine and builds on Windows must be performed on a Windows machine with all the requirements installed (XCode, C++ compilers etc.).

To package the Editor, just use the "**package**" command.

```bash
# For the current platform and architecture
yarn package --noSign

# By providing the target architecture
yarn package --noSign --x64

# For both architectures
yarn package --noSign --arm64 --x64
```

This will re-install the depdendencies to ensure they are up-to-date, build the Editor and its tools to finally package the Electron application for the desired target.

In order to sign the application on **macOS**, you need to add a **.env** file at the root of the repository and set the following environment variables:

```env
APPLE_ID=
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=
APPLE_TEAM_ID=
```

Then use the package command by omitting the **--noSign** flag:

```bash
# For the current platform and architecture
yarn package

# By providing the target architecture
yarn package --x64

# For both architectures
yarn package --arm64 --x64
```
