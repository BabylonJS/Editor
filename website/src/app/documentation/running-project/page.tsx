							Introduction
						</div>

						<div>
							Projects can be played directly from the editor. A project can be composed of multiple scenes and some scripts may be attached to objects in the scene(s).
							<br />
							Here are 2 options:
							<ul className="list-disc">
								<li>
									<b>play the current scene</b>: all the scripts are compiled on the fly and executed in the current scene that is displayed in the editor, sharing the same resources (textures, etc.).
									This is the default behavior of the editor.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>play the project as-is</b>: consists on running the command <b>dev</b> using the project's selected package manager (npm, yarn, bun or pnpm).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						{/* <div className="flex gap-2 items-center">
							<IoIosWarning size="32px" />

							<div className="italic">
								Only the current scene being edited in the editor will be executed and all the scripts that are attached to the objects will be executed.
							</div>
						</div> */}

						<div className="text-3xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl my-3">
							Playing the current scene
						</div>

						<div>
							To start the current scene, just click the start button
							<div className="inline-block px-2">
								<IoPlay className="w-6 h-6" strokeWidth={1} color="green" />
							</div>
							located in the toolbar of the editor's preview panel.
						</div>

						<div>
							Each time the current scene is played, the editor will update the assets located in the <b>public</b> folder of the project.
							If new assets were added to the project (especially images), this can take few seconds too to generate all new necessary files
							before the project can be played.
						</div>

						<div>
							Note that when playing, all the scripts are watched for changes and will be reloaded automatically when modified until the "play" mode is stopped.
						</div>

						<div className="text-3xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl my-3">
							Stopping the current scene
						</div>

						<div>
							To stop the current scene being played and get back to the edit mode, just click the stop button
							<div className="inline-block px-2">
								<IoStop className="w-6 h-6" strokeWidth={1} color="red" />
							</div>
							located in the toolbar of the editor's preview panel.
						</div>

						<div className="text-3xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl my-3">
							Refreshing the current scene
						</div>

						<div>
							Sometimes, it's useful to refresh the scene that is being played instead of stopping it and starting it again.
							This allows to bypass the export process or the editor. Just click the refresh button
							<div className="inline-block px-2">
								<IoRefresh className="w-6 h-6" strokeWidth={1} />
							</div>
							located in the toolbar of the editor's preview panel.
						</div>

						</div>

						<div className="text-3xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl my-3">
							Playing as-is
						</div>

						<div>
							To play the project as-is, simply select <b>"Run Project..."</b> in the main toolbar of the editor.
							<br />
							On macOS, use the toolbar of the app.
						</div>

						<div>
							By default, projects are based on <b>Next.JS</b> and the <b>dev</b> command will start a new server. When playing as-is and once the server is ready the editor will
							open the default browser to display the game / application.
						</div>

						<div className="flex gap-2 items-center">
